# .NET Documentation using DOCFX

## Introduction
This tutorial helps you create useful doucmentation for your ASP.NET core-project using DOCFX.
docfx's features are generating documentation from your C#-code, as well as from Swagger-conform json-files describing a REST API.
You can also include conceptual markdown files to have documentation written in your own words.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have a recent edition of Visual Studio as well as ASP.NET Core installed.

## Getting Started

First of all we set up 3 simple .NET Core projects to generate documentation from.
Open Visual Studio and create a new .NET Core-Web application and select API.
Next create a new .NET core-class library within your solution and add the following code. This is the small business logic in our example.

[!code-csharp[SimpleDivision](../../../src/CalculatorLibrary/Calculator.cs)]

In the Web Application change the Controller's code with the following one. The Web API Controller is just responsible for calling a 
method that's in our business logic and return the result. Nothing special.

[!code-csharp[CalculatorController](../../../src/Calculator/Controllers/CalculatorController.cs)]

For our business logic, create a model folder within the WebApi project and the following .cs file:

[!code-csharp[CalculationParams](../../../src/Calculator/Model/CalculationParams.cs)]

Last we create a .NET Core xUnit Test project with a simple unit test as follows:

[!code-csharp[SimpleDivision](../../../src/CalculatorTest/CalculatorTest.cs)]

Now the code is set for our little example.
Next step is setting up the documentation. For that create a new empty .NET Core Web project and install the NuGet-package "docfx.console".

## Generating code documentation
Building the docs web project will set up all files needed for the documentation.
In order to generate the documentation from source, we need the DocFx command line tool (install it either via MSI or Chocolatery)
[Installer](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/releases)

[Chocolatery](https://chocolatey.org/install) and install command:
```cmd
choco install docfx -y
```
The documentation output is saved to a _site directory within the project root, and can be served by any web server. For generating files and serving the site type

```cmd
docfx --serve
```
in the project root (or elsewhere and specify the path to the docfx.json config file.)

For our code to be found we have to tell docfx where it is, that's done within "metadata" in our docfx.json; specify the path to your src:

```json
      "src": [
        {
          "files": [
            "**.csproj"
          ],
          "src": "../../src"
        }
      ],
```

### The toc-files

The toc-files (table of content) are respons√≠ble for the docs site's structure.
.yml and .md can be used as file types, although yml is recommended, as it is capable of more functionality.

A sample toc-file could look like this:
Each bullet point is one element in the site's nav bar at the top.
"name" is the title displayed in the documentation and "href" is the relative path to a folder.

```yml
- name: Articles
  href: articles/
- name: Api Documentation
  href: api/
- name: REST API
  href: restapi/
```
Within the folders there can be *.yml files describing code or *.md files with text or another toc file.
The second toc file's content is displayed in a nav bar at the left-hand side of the page. But you can also nest toc-files even more - DocFx searches the folder structure recursively for toc-files. Those other toc-files will be nested on the left nav bar.

## Getting documentation for REST Services

DocFx is able to read REST service information that's in swagger/open api format.
Just put those file(s) in a folder, and create an according toc.yml there - the rest is up to DocFx. 

```yml
- name: REST API
  href: swagger.json
```

In this example we use Swashbuckle for saving our API's structure. Install "Swashbuckle.AspNetCore" in your CalculatorWebApi project and add the following to your *.csproj file:

```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Cli" Version="2.1.0-beta1" />
  </ItemGroup>

  <Target Name="SwaggerToFile" AfterTargets="AfterBuild">
    <Exec Command="dotnet swagger tofile --output ../../docs/CalculatorDocumentation/restapi/swagger.json $(OutputPath)$(AssemblyName).dll v1" />
  </Target>
```

and to configure swagger alter the project's Startup.cs file:

```cs
// Add to the ConfigureServices method:
            services.AddSwaggerGen(c =>
            {
                c.SwaggerDoc("v1", new Info { Title = "CalculatorAPI", Version = "v1" });
            });
// Add to the Configure method:
            app.UseSwagger();
```

Now everytime we build this project a swagger json file is generated.

## Adding conceptual markdown-files

Often it's useful to have some verbal explanation along the technical documentation. For that, markdown-files can be added.
Just place them in a folder and add them to its toc-file. (In this example the conceptual files are located in /articles )

```md
# Conceptual files
can be useful often.
```

## Filtering unnecessary elements

Some information just doesn't help us understand software better. That' why it's possible to hide certain files or code.
For that we just create a filterConfig.yml file in the docs root folder. DocFx looks which code is matched by the regular expressions defined in the file. 
We've excluded the Program and Startup classes, as their job ist just setting up the projects and some external library code we don't need to know about.

> Note: If several exclusion rules for an element are defined, the uppermost will apply.

```yml
apiRules: 
  - exclude:
      uidRegex: ^CalculatorWebApi\.Program
  - exclude:
      uidRegex: ^CalculatorWebApi\.Startup
  - exclude:
      uidRegex: ^Microsoft\.AspNetCore
  - exclude:
      uidRegex: ^System.Object
  - exclude:
      uidRegex: ^CalculatorTest
```

Now add this line in your docfx.json config file within "metadata":

```yml
      "filter": "filterConfig.yml"
```
# Overwrite Files
Sometimes it can be useful to replace the automatically generated docs with a verbal text.
This can be done via *.md-files. Just specify the uid of the element you want to write your own text about.
You can either write text for a given category (e.g. "remarks") or a general text that is placed at the top of the element's docs.

```md
---
uid: CalculatorLibrary.Calculator.Div(System.Int32,System.Int32)
remarks: overriden remarks
---

If you type text here, it will be added to the docs just under the top of the element.
```
# Template Customization
DOCFX's templates can be overwritten and extended. Export the default template in cmd using:

```cmd
docfx template export default
```
now there's a new folder named _exported_templates with another folder inside called default.
Next, create a "templates" folder in your project's root. Copy the file _exported_templates/default/styles/main.css into this folder.
Be sure to also put it into a styles folder - if you want to override some of the default template's funcionality the file and directory structure has to be the same.
We just add some simple css for demonstration purposes:
```css
h1 {
  color:gray;
}
```
Now we just have to include our "templates" folder in our docfx.json so that the changes can be applied:

```json
    "template": [
      "default",
      "templates"
    ],
```
This will merge our own template with the default one.
After the next build our template should come into effect.

As a last step we edit a template partial for the REST documentation.
Unfortunately swagger type definitions are not supported by docfx's default template, that's why we modify the default template to hide the resulting empty rows.
For more information on that issue go to the [Github issue](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/issues/2072)

Similiar to the above css replacement we navigate to the exported default folder and copy the file partials/rest.child.tmpl.partial to our template folder.

Remove the following code in the partial file:

```html
ln 34      <th>Type</th>
ln 35      <th>Value</th>
```

```html
ln 44      <td>{{type}}</td>
ln 45      <td>{{default}}</td>
```

```html
ln 61        <th>Samples</th>
```

```html
ln 70     <td class="sample-response">
            {{#examples}}
            <div class="mime-type">
              <i>Mime type: </i><span class="mime">{{mimeType}}</span>
            </div>
            <pre class="response-content"><code class="lang-js json hljs">{{content}}</code></pre>
            {{/examples}}
          </td>
```

The resulting folder structure of the templates-directory should look as follows:

```
templates
  partials
    rest.child.tmpl.partial
  styles
    main.css
```

# The final docfx.json file:

To round it up a short explanation of the docfx config file:

## metadata:

```json
"metadata": [
    {
      "src": [
        {
          "files": [
            "**.csproj"
          ],
          "src": "../../src"
        }
      ],
      "dest": "api",
      "filter": "filterConfig.yml"
    }
  ],
```

Docfx will generate metadata from .csproj files that are within the specified src folder, and put the results in the api/ directory, 
doing all that with the specified filter configuration.
If you happen to have .cs files that are in no projects, you can also include them in the files array.

## build:

### content:

Build is responsible for putting it all together to make the docs ready to be served.

```json
    "content": [
      {
        "files": [
          "articles/**.md",
          "articles/**/toc.yml",
          "restapi/**",
          "toc.yml",
          "*.md"
        ]
      }
    ],
```
in the content array the conceptual files to be included in the documentation are specified.

### resource:

```json
    "resource": [
      {
        "files": [
          "images/**"
        ]
      }
    ],
```
We don't use it in this example, but it's possible to include pictures in the documentation. The directory containing the images is specified here.

### overwrite:

```json
    "overwrite": [
      {
        "files": [
          "overwrite/**.md"
        ]
      }
    ],
```
overwrite configures the path to markdownfiles replacing parts of the generated metadata docs.

### template:
```json
    "template": [
      "default",
      "templates"
    ],
```
The top template (default in this case) is the first one to be applied, after that, our custom one (templates folder) overrides parts of the default one. Remember, for our template to override the default one, it has to resemble the original's folder structure.
